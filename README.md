SCREENS



LOCATIONS in-game

Main Road (1st Street): This is the very first location of our game. This is where the story starts. You play as a detective tasked to solve the murder of Melvin K. Bridges, the former mayor of DATASAL town.

Hospital (2nd Street): This is where Dr. Gilligans hangs out. She is considered a suspect because she interacted with the victim the day he died and was said to be in a special relationship with him.

Evidence Gathered: In this place, you will be able to pick up this bottle. This might prove her innocence/guilt.

Bakery (3rd Street): This is where Paul Brioche hangs out. He is considered a suspect because he was rumored to have gotten into a big fight with the victim on the day of the crime.

Evidence Gathered: In this place, a ripped piece of paper will serve as a clue about the two’s argument and the mayor’s relationship with another suspect.

Police Station (4th Street): This is where you can talk to Police Officer Thompson and ask his opinions about the town or the suspects.

Evidence Gathered: None

Town Park (5th Street): This is where the crime took place a night ago.

Evidence Gathered: None

Construction Site (6th Street): This is where you can find and interrogate Sam Brik. He is considered a suspect because he had filed a complaint against the mayor that day.

Evidence Gathered: Here, there will be a clue (hollow block) that could implicate the worker. You will also find out about his possible reason for killing the mayor.

School (7th Street): This is where student Lisa Simmons is. She is considered a suspect because she was around crime scene before the body was discovered.

Evidence Gathered: Here you will find a poster that might serve as the key to understanding if she had a motive to murder the victim.
